        <p><mark>Preventive dentistry</mark> is dental care that helps maintain good oral health. It’s a combination of regular dental 
            check-ups along with developing good habits like brushing and flossing. Taking care of your teeth starts early 
            in childhood and extends throughout the course of your life.
        </p>

       

        <h2>What’s your role in preventive dental care?</h2>
        <p>Much of your preventive dental care starts with you. Developing healthy dental habits early in life can help reduce <br>
            cavities, gum disease, and gingivitis.1 Here are the basics of good oral health:</p>
            <li>Floss daily to get food that’s stuck between teeth before it turns to plaque.</li>
            <li>Use a mouthwash to rinse out food particles after flossing.</li>
            <li>Avoid acidic foods that can harm tooth enamel.</li>

            <mark>Restorative dentistry</mark> focuses on repairing or replacing damaged or missing teeth. 
            These procedures help improve oral health and function. Common dental restorations 
            include crowns, bridges and implants.

        <h2>What are the risks of restorative dentistry?</h2>
        <p>
            The most common risk is sensitivity or general discomfort after a restorative dentistry procedure. 
            Very rarely, you may get an infection or have an allergic reaction to the metals used. Dental restorations 
            have very few risks. But crowns, for example, may become chipped or loosened. If you have deep cavities or delay 
            getting cavities filled, that can lead to root canal therapy or tooth extraction. Contact a dentist right away if you
            have a problem with your teeth.
